# highlight-words

![screencast](https://github.com/rsbondi/highlight-words/raw/master/images/highlight.gif)

This extension is adapted from the sample VS code extension decorator-sample, inspired by atom-quick-highlight.

It creates a decoration for each selected word that appears in all editors. 

# Usage

* You can add words by chosing **Highlight Toggle Current** from the command pallet, this will highlight the word at the cursor or the selection.  
* To stop highlighting, choose **Highlight Remove**, then the desired word or expression, or all
* You may also remove all from the command **Highlight Remove All** without the prompt for selection
* To highlight using regular expression choose **Highlight Expression** and enter expression(slashes optional, can ignore case with `/expression/i`(g flag is automatic, i flag accepted, all others ignored).  
* To highlight with options choose **Highlight Selection with Options** and choose `whole word`, `ignore case` or `both` when presented
* You can set the mode for "Highlight Toggle Current" from the **Set Highlight Mode** command.  The default can be set in the configuration.
* Sidebar can show in explorer view and can be toggled on and off with **Highlight Toggle Sidebar** command.  This provides features such as navigating highlighted items, context menu for changing options and removing.
